Notochord
<p></p>
The chordates are named for the notochord: a flexible, rod-shaped structure that is found in the embryonic stage of all chordates and also in the adult stage of some chordate species. It is located between the digestive tube and the nerve cord, providing skeletal support through the length of the body. In some chordates, the notochord acts as the primary axial support of the body throughout the animal’s lifetime.

In vertebrates, the notochord is present during embryonic development, at which time it induces the development of the neural tube which serves as a support for the developing embryonic body. The notochord, however, is replaced by the vertebral column (spine) in most adult vertebrates.
Dorsal Hollow Nerve Cord
<p></p>
The dorsal hollow nerve cord derives from ectoderm that rolls into a hollow tube during development. In chordates, it is located dorsally (at the top of the animal) to the notochord. In contrast to the chordates, other animal phyla are characterized by solid nerve cords that are located either ventrally or laterally. The nerve cord found in most chordate embryos develops into the brain and spinal cord, which comprise the central nervous system.
Pharyngeal Slits
<p></p>
Pharyngeal slits are openings in the pharynx (the region just posterior to the mouth) that extend to the outside environment. In organisms that live in aquatic environments, pharyngeal slits allow for the exit of water that enters the mouth during feeding. Some invertebrate chordates use the pharyngeal slits to filter food out of the water that enters the mouth. In vertebrate fishes, the pharyngeal slits develop into gill arches, the bony or cartilaginous gill supports.

In most terrestrial animals, including mammals and birds, pharyngeal slits are present only during embryonic development. In these animals, the pharyngeal slits develop into the jaw and inner ear bones.

    <h2>Q4b</h2>
    Jawless fish are the most primitive fishes living today. Jawless fish:
    
        Lack jaws.
        Feed by suction with the help of a round muscular mouth and rows of teeth.
        Have cylindrical and long bodies.
        Do not have paired fins and scales like most fish.
    
    There are two categories of jawless fish: hagfish and lampreys.
    
    Hagfish
    
    Hagfish usually feed on dead or dying fish. These fish can be found around the tunnels they dig in muddy bottoms, in moderate depths and cold waters. Scientists only know of about 20 species of hagfish worldwide.
    
    Lampreys
    
    Lampreys are mostly freshwater fish and can be found in temperate regions. Temperate regions lie between the tropics and the polar regions. They breed in rivers and lakes, but some move to the sea as adults. Lampreys depend on other fish for food. Some species of lampreys attach to other fish and suck their blood. They also feed on bottom invertebrates. Worldwide, about 30 species of lampreys exist. 
    
    <P></P>
    The cartilaginous fish are jawed fish with paired fins, paired nostrils, scales, two-chambered hearts, and skeletons made of cartilage rather than bone. Examples of the cartilaginous fish include sharks, rays, and skates.
    <p></p>
    Bony fishes share several distinguishing features: a skeleton of bone, scales, paired fins, one pair of gill openings, jaws, and paired nostrils. Osteichthyes includes the largest number of living species of all scientific classes of vertebrates, more than 28,000 species.</h1>

<div class="main">
The post-anal tail is a posterior elongation of the body, extending beyond the anus. The tail contains skeletal elements and muscles, which provide a source of locomotion in aquatic species. In some terrestrial vertebrates, the tail also helps with balance, courting, and signaling when danger is near. In humans and other apes, the post-anal tail is present during embryonic development, but is vestigial as an adult.
<h2>Q2</h2>
Phylum Chordata is divided into three subphyla: Urochordata or Tunicata, Cephalochordata and Vertebrata. Subphyla Urochordata and Cephalochordata are often referred to as protochordates and are exclusively marine.
<h2>Q3</h2>
Invertebrates are animals without spines, while vertebrates have a spine.
<h2>Q4</h2>
Fishes are aquatic; cold blooded vertebrates.
Their body is divisible into head, trunk and tail. Neck is absent.
It has a spindle shaped body. It is helpful in swimming.
The body is covered by scales. They are placoid scales, cycloid scales, ctenoid scales, ganoid scales etc.
Respiration is by gills. Gills are the extensions of the pharynx. In the elasmobranches fishes, the gills will open separate. In bony fishes the gill slits are covered by operculum.
On the head a pair of nostrils are present internal nostril are absent. In Dipnoi Internal nostrils are present
On the head a pair of eyes is present.
On the lateral sides of the body LATERAL LINE SENSE organs are present. They detect the pressure changes of water.
The body shows paired and unpaired fins. Pelvic and pectoral fins are paired. Dorsal and ventral fins are unpaired. They maintain balance in water. They are useful for locomotion.
The digestive system is well developed. In the intestine of shark scroll valve Is present. The nervous system contains brain and spinal cord. Brain is small & it will not occupy the entire cranial cavity.
10 pairs of cranial nerves are present.
Kidneys are mesonephrlc.
Urinary bladder is absent
The skeleton of some fishes is made by cartilage. They are called cartilage fishes. 
In some fishes the skeleton is made by bone. They are called bony fishes.
In some fresh water fishes accessory respiratory organs are present. They will take up aerial respiration.
Sexes are separate. In male sharks claspers are present.
Many fishes are oviparous. Some fishes are viviparous.
In the development of fishes amnion is not developed. Hence these animals are called anamniotes.
